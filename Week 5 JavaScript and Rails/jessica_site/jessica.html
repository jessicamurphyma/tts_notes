    <h2>My Bio</h2>

    <p>My name is Jessica Murphy.  I am from originally from the Atlanta, GA area.  I moved
    to Phoenix approximately 10 years ago.</p>

    <p>In Atlanta, I worked as a sign language interpreter.  I moved to Phoenix because
    there were opportunities for interpreters.  After moving, I quickly became an instructor.
    A few years later, I decided that my next opportunity would be in disability services.  I pursued
    a master's degree believing that I would work in disabilities services.  After graduating, however, I 
    was told that I was <em>overqualified</em>.  After one of these occassions, I met a woman from Women Who Code (WOC). 
    She told me that she loves teaching women to code.  Those words changed my life.  Since that time, I have
    gone to every meetup, workshop and conference that I could attend.</p>

    <p>After my encounter with the developer from WOC, I have taken a few classes.  Some of those classes include (but are not limited to):</p>

    <ul>
      <li>HTML | CSS | Javascript  | Ruby (CodeAcademy)</li>
      <li>Creating Web Pages (Gale Courses)</li>
      <li>Introduction to CSS3 and HTML5 (Gale Courses)</li>
      <li>Introduction to JavaScript (Gale Courses)</li>
      <li>The Complete Web Developer Course (Udemy)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It has been fun working with everyone in our Tech Talent South code immersion class. <span><strong>Let's stay in touch!</strong></span></p>
