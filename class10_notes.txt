Lesson 10 - Intro to Ruby on Rails


Why Ruby on Rails
- can build quickly
Has generators and cool things to use.  Can make twitter clones, blogs…
Many companies use rails in some form.

Rails will release 5 soon.  
Frameworks and languages change a lot.
For developers, there is a constant learning curve.

To start: rails command
rails new name

cd into app

rails s then a second terminal to work
ctrl c - to stop

More to play with
app, assets, controllers, models, views: 

  The controller:
    ie make post - post controller and new (method in there) to interact with models - interact with database - validations

  Views - languages like html and haml
    erb - embedded ruby tags

  yield statement - the view and what showing
    view for posts, view for comments
    change in yield depending on what person looking at.

  config - code and documentation

  tests are important - test controllers, feature, testing models
    rails has testing but there are others.

  Gitignore
  post work but never environmental keys to github
  gitignore - github cannot access private files

  Readme 
    Where to find my app
    How to use components of the app

  scaffold command - makes the controller; most developers do not use
    make views

MVC - software architecture

First to the controller
goes to model and gives a view

It created migration file and we must migrate with 
rake db:migrate

http://localhost:3000/pizzas/1

[1 is the id]

google  - rails validations
  makes pizza_controller but can be black
  under pizza.rb add validation

Embedded ruby tags:
<% this will not displayed
<%= will be displayed

If you don’t know what to do in rails look at routes and read

Easier way of getting bootstrap 

Add gem file
go to gem file then read documentation to change things

rails c - rails console
  This is to look at ActiveRecord
  To end quit
